# Wedding-blog
#### It is a responsive wedding blog, but when we see it on a mobile phone. It looks fantastic 😍.
#### This blog is created using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. In this backend, I used NODE JS and MongoDB to store the contact details of users.

I know that I don't add any wedding images to this blog. I just want to add real images to this blog, But believe me when images are added to this blog looks fantastic 😍.
